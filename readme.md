# The Odin Project Assignment 11 : A ToDo List

## Assignment 
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

Create a ToDo List tracker.  Should organize tasks into projects.

## Summary of Learning
* Gained More practice with React Hooks.  useEffect FTW!
* Used Formik to create the forms.  Had interesting effects but easier than regular forms.
* Hooks still got messy as they were drilled down from App to the last component.  Next big project will start with REDUX.  
* Worked hard to break this into components.  Next time, will work harder to organize files from the start. 
* Incorportes LocalStorage and JSON.
* Settings hooks as the same array... `[...toDoLibrary] ` was an interesting problem.
* made React keys using `date.now()` Helped keep them unique. 
* Made a transition animation to cross off task.  Fun!
